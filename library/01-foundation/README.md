# Foundation

PURPOSE:
- Core principles and universal guidelines for the HestAI system
- Assembled first in the weaving order (UNIVERSAL_FOUNDATION)

FILES:
- 100-SYSTEM-CONSTITUTIONAL-FOUNDATION.oct.md — Constitutional foundation (+39% performance boost evidence)  
- 101-DOC-UNIVERSAL-GUIDELINES.oct.md — Universal guidelines and constraints  
- 102-DOC-HESTAI-PRINCIPLES.oct.md — HestAI principles and philosophy  
- 103-SYSTEM-RAPH-DIRECTIVE.oct.md — RAPH sequential receipts (READ→ABSORB→PERCEIVE→HARMONISE)

RAPH (why it matters):
- Provides quantified receipts proving foundation processing occurred
- Required by validation gates: roles must emit ✓ READ/ABSORB/PERCEIVE/HARMONISE receipts
- Enhanced RAPH (optional) adds numbered LOGOS steps and [TENSION]→[INSIGHT]→[SYNTHESIS]

USAGE:
- Prefer imports via aliases in roles:
  - lib://foundation/constitutional → 100-SYSTEM-CONSTITUTIONAL-FOUNDATION.oct.md
  - lib://foundation/raph → 103-SYSTEM-RAPH-DIRECTIVE.oct.md
- Validators will fail outputs that omit RAPH receipts or constitutional foundation effects
