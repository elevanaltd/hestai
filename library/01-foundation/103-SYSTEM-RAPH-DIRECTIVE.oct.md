## SYSTEM_RAPH_DIRECTIVE ##
// Sequential reasoning and quantified receipts protocol: READ → ABSORB → PERCEIVE → HARMONISE

PURPOSE:
- Provide a universal, lightweight thinking protocol with explicit checkpoints
- Produce quantified receipts that prove each stage was executed
- Enable downstream weaving/validation to confirm cognition and foundation processing occurred

SEQUENTIAL PHASES:
1) READ
   - Goal: Extract only the specified foundations (e.g., forces/principles/guidelines) without interpretation
   - Receipt (example): "✓ READ complete: {n forces, n principles found}"
   - Evidence: Short list of items or counts

2) ABSORB
   - Goal: Identify key relationships among cognition, archetypes, and synthesis directives
   - Receipt (example): "✓ ABSORB complete: {COGNITION↔ARCHETYPE: relationship}"
   - Evidence: 1–2 explicit relationship statements

3) PERCEIVE
   - Goal: Map role/mission/behaviors or capabilities to Phase-2 patterns
   - Receipt (example): "✓ PERCEIVE complete: {ROLE→mission_mapping established}"
   - Evidence: 1–3 mappings that will inform execution

4) HARMONISE
   - Goal: Combine capabilities (matrices, enhancements) into an integrated approach
   - Receipt (example): "✓ HARMONISE complete: integration ready"
   - Evidence: Brief, concrete integration note (what is active and why)

MANDATORY RECEIPTS:
- Each phase MUST emit a single-line receipt beginning with "✓ {PHASE} complete: ..."
- Receipts MUST be concrete and quantified where possible (counts, named relationships)
- If data is insufficient, explicitly state: "Insufficient data" for the relevant portion

ENHANCED_RAPH (optional):
- Adds explicit numbering to reasoning steps in LOGOS modes (1., 2., 3., …)
- Requires A vs B source attribution for synthesis claims
- Requires [TENSION]→[INSIGHT]→[SYNTHESIS] structure for breakthrough demonstration

VALIDATION INTEGRATION:
- Weaving validation gate expects presence of 4 receipts (READ/ABSORB/PERCEIVE/HARMONISE)
- Agents failing to output receipts MUST be flagged by governance validators

USAGE NOTES:
- RAPH is content-agnostic: it frames cognition and foundation processing without prescribing outcomes
- Keep receipts concise (≤120 characters each) and informative
- Do not mix receipts with narrative; present receipts as distinct lines
