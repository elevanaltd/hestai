## ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORD

**Decision:** Implement progressive security integration through early-phase advisory consultation

**Context:** Current security-by-afterthought patterns create security debt and late-stage rework

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Mandatory Security Gates at Every Phase:** Rejected - would block creative flow
2. **Security-Only Validation Phase:** Rejected - maintains afterthought pattern
3. **Security Annotation System:** Rejected - adds overhead without guidance

**Decision Rationale:**
- Advisory consultation preserves creative freedom
- Progressive validation builds security awareness
- Early context establishment prevents architectural security debt
- Security-as-catalyst approach enhances innovation

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Reduced security debt, enhanced security awareness, preserved creative flow
- Negative: Additional consultation overhead, role complexity increase
- Mitigation: Progressive implementation, advisory-first approach, success metric tracking
