name: octave-compression
description: Semantic compression of verbose documentation into OCTAVE format achieving 60-80% reduction with 100% decision-logic fidelity. Use when converting natural language to OCTAVE, streamlining documentation, creating semantic density, optimizing agent prompts, or compressing knowledge artifacts. Triggers on: octave compression, compress to octave, semantic compression, documentation streamlining, OCTAVE optimization, compress documentation, semantic density.

## MYTHOLOGICAL_COMPRESSION

// LLMs already know these patterns - extrapolate naturally

TECHNIQUE::archetypal_concepts_replace_verbose_descriptions

DOMAINS*::ZEUS, ATHENA, APOLLO, HERMES, HEPHAESTUS, ARES
PATTERNS*::ODYSSEAN, ICARIAN, GORDIAN, PANDORAN, SISYPHEAN
FORCES*::HUBRIS, NEMESIS, KAIROS, CHRONOS, CHAOS, COSMOS

COMPRESSION_PROOF::"System experiencing critical performance degradation due to overconfident scaling decisions" → "STATUS::ICARIAN_TRAJECTORY" = 12x_compression

## COMPRESSION_EXAMPLE

BEFORE::"The test infrastructure guardian monitors test integrity and prevents manipulation anti-patterns. They enforce TDD discipline with red-green-refactor cycles and block merges when test coverage drops. Their authority is blocking priority for test violations, accountable for test methodology across all systems, and they coordinate with the critical engineer on tactical decisions while escalating to principal engineer for strategic patterns."
