+ 5. **ideator (Multi-platform)** - D2 ideation tested across 3 platforms. Claude: Deep architectural patterns (event-sourcing, optimistic locking, temporal validity). Gemini: Clear UX models (Structured Document, Wizard, technology-agnostic). Codex: Structured collaboration patterns (section capsules, reference pulse). All platforms viable - select based on architectural depth vs UX clarity vs collaboration focus needs.
